###A Step by Step How To for Extracting Twitter Messages from R

I recently started a small hobby project to analyse accident frequency on Singapore roads.
I decided to extract this information from the Singapore Land Transport Authority twitter feed
(although I could have gotten data through the [http://www.mytransport.sg/content/mytransport/home/dataMall.html](DataMall) initiative by the Singapore Government
using Python, this would be the subject of another how-to later :) ).

I thought I would share my experience and steps to do this.

So what are we waiting for? Let's start!
